Imagine traveling back to 2017 with a mission to help the NYPD predict shooting incidents over the next five years. This scenario mirrors my data analysis project. Understanding that the period post-2017 was marked by economic and general instability, I hypothesized this would impact shooting case numbers similarly to the effects of the 2008 economic crash on unknown shooter cases.
To test this, I analyzed data from 2006-2012, focusing on unknown shooter incidents. I normalized the data to a 2006 baseline, allowing each year's cases to be represented as a multiple of 2006's figures. I then adapted this model to use 2017's data as a new baseline, predicting cases for 2018-2022.
The results were significant. My custom model outperformed a traditional linear model developed using pre-2018 data. While the linear model's error rate peaked at over 60%, my approach capped at around 11% error. This substantial improvement in accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of considering economic and social contexts in predictive modeling.
